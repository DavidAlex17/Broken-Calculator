## Overview
A Broken calculator concept. A calculator that is dysfunctional, ugly, and can not even calculate! 

jokes aside, The code is built with simple, easily readible semantic code containing data attributes for javascript. For CSS styling, it is organized and readible. It is build using modern tools such as flexbox and CSS grid. To add for the win, media queries for responsives! In Javascript, you have functions for clickevents in its respective function... buttons, operations, display, clear, to which, are all called on a class; and are computed on the values off the first and second number.

As we improve our skills individually, we plan on making the calculator more functinoal, less ugly, but less broke none the less!
